# Genesis

Recreated the popular graphing calculator "Desmos" on Python using matplotlib, scipy and numpy. Genesis can be used as an extensive graphing application that can plot 2D and 3D curves, while also being able to integrate and differentiate functions.

# To Do

- Remake the 3D graphing aspect, making it easier for graphing complex and cartesian co-ordinates on the same graph, and a nice colourful GUI with it.

- Add polar curves and coordinates to be able to be plotted 
- Restructure all code into one place for just one application for graphing every type of graph
- Support more graphs in general

# How to run? 

It's slightly buggy at the moment but each file can be run by running `python <filename>.py`
